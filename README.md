## What is this?
Here are some of the resources that I used that helped me learn, understand, and master Javascript. I will be updating this from time-to-time whenever I discover a new tool that helped me understand certain Javascript concepts. Please share if this has helped you as much as it did me.

### Other Concept Videos
Besides the concepts I had learned from the certifications I have done in JS and ReactJS, I taught myself more stuff by watching course videos, taking notes, and doing tons of practice problems. Some of the concepts I touched on are:
1. [Data Structures and Algorithms  - Beau Teaches Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkso-IbgiiP48n-O-JQA9PJ). These videos cover the following data structures: stacks, sets, queues & priority queues, binary search tree, map vs object, hash tables, linked list, trie data structures, heap data structures, graphs, breadth-first search. 
2. [Breadth First Search & Depth First Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKY4hjDrxk) 
3. [Codevolution's React JS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFaFIcGhPoM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3) - A comprehensive walk-through of everything React JS, React Render, and React Typescript. 

### Cool Tools
1. RegExr: I'll be honest, RegExp is not my favorite and is definitely something I need a refresher on from time to time. Though FCC's course included a unit on Regular Expressions, for some reason, I had trouble retaining the information so I searched for a tool that made it easier and simpler to learn and understand it. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/), made by Grant Skinner (check out his repo [here](https://github.com/gskinner/regexr/)) is super cool! I strongly advise you all to check this out!

4. [ReactJS Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/react)

### My Favorite YouTubers
